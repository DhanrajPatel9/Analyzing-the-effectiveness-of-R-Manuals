# Analyzing-the-effectiveness-of-R-Manuals

The main purpose of this study is to investigate if an R manual was effective in teaching a class the R programming language with no prior assumed programming experience before. In order to do this the students in the class were asked to fill out surveys in the beginning of the course and about the half way through the course. The questions were all ordinal and inquired about their past programming experiences and their current understanding of R at the point of taking the survey. Using the technical questions we can calculate a composite score that represents the students R proficiency and compare them between the two surveys to compare proficiency progress. Due to low sample size in the second survey we used a non parametric test to compare the surveys and found no statistically significant deviation in the central mean with a P value of 0.06608 (greater than 0.05). In addition, using linear regression and step-wise for model selection, we found out which of the other questions in the survey most contributed to the composite score and to what degree. From our results we found that the most important variables were R previous experience, R confidence level, university level previous statistics experience and high school level previous statistics with all these variables having a P value below 0.05.
